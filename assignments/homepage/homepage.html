						<p><img src="lsprs_milliron.jpg" style="float:left;margin-right:20px;">
						Oxide semiconductors are frequently observed with a localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) at various energy regimes.<a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.chemrev.7b00613"><sup>1</sup></a> These plasmon absorption features can be used in a variety of practical applications such Infrared Neural Stimulation (INS) for treating mental disorders such as Parkinson's or Alzheimer's, or for commercial use in "Smart Window" type applications that can be turned on and off with applied voltage.</p>
						<h4>Morphology Control</h4>
						<p>The resonance frequency of a plasmon has been shown in previous literature to be highly dependent on morphology.<a href=""><sup>[cit needed]</sup></a> It is proposed that by carefully controlling the morphology of a plasmonic nanoparticle along specific x, y, and z axes, the spectral shape of a plasmonic feature can be controllably modified by its resonance frequency and peak intensity.</p>

					<td><!--Second Column Body-->
						<p><img src="mcd_setup.jpg" style="float:left;margin-right:20px;">
						In collaboration with Dr. Steve McGill at the National High Magnetic Field Lab (NHMFL), Jason is working on the development and optimiziation of a high field, low temperature, mid-infrared (MIR) Magnetic Circular Dichroism (MCD) setup. Previous literature works are largely limited to low field, MIR MCD measurements, however with high field it is apparent that new MCD features are observed to appear and disappear as field from 5 - 10 T are explored in previously thought to be exhausted materials such as Zinc Oxide (ZnO) and Indium Tin Oxide (ITO).</p>
						<h4>Magnetic Circular Dichroism</h4>			
						<p>MCD is a difference absorption spectroscopy technique. By using a magnetic field to induce Zeeman spliting in the energy levels of a semiconductor material, differences between left and right circularly polarized light (LCP, RCP) are observed, resulting in an MCD spectrum. Spectra are typically deconvoluted and classified by the identification of three separate A, B, and C terms.</p>
